# Brain Computer

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is perhaps one of the simplest and easy ways to understand brain activities. EEG records the electrical signals produced by neurons amplifies them and show them as waveforms. If we can understand this waveform, then we can identify what our brain trying to do. Example: Consider an operation on the music system, say increasing and decreasing volume. If we can learn the waveform for volume increase and volume decrease, we can control volume without actually touching any device.
